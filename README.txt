## Stock Tracker Lite ##
> This app allows public users to track the current value of their stocks based on near real time pricing.

> The Stock tracker is a web-based tool that allows users to enter past purchases of stocks with prices.
> This tool also will show current value of these purchases using the near real time pricing.
> The tool also will provide a sum total of all positions the user has added.

## Problem ##
> Users do not currently have an easy way to track their individual stock purchases in near real time.

## Solution ##
> The Stock Tracker provides a simple way for the user to enter historic transactions and the app will provide a
current value of that purchase based on current pricing.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Users can access the app at http://localhost:3000 to begin adding positions (stocks with a price and share amount.)
  > Once user has added a 'position', the app will provide current pricing for their number of shares, and
  display their current value of that position (+ or -)
